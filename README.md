# Grid Ball Game with Speed and Resolution Control

This is a simple grid-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where two balls move around a grid. Players can control the game speed and canvas resolution dynamically using sliders.

## Features

- **Dynamic Speed Control**: Adjust the speed of the game (frames per second) using a slider.
- **Dynamic Resolution Control**: Adjust the canvas size (resolution) using a slider.
- **Grid-Based Game**: The balls move around a grid and color the cells as they move.
- **Collision Detection**: The balls bounce off the walls and change direction upon reaching the edges of the canvas.
- **Scoreboard**: Keep track of how many cells are colored by each ball.

## Demo

You can try the live demo of the project by opening the `index.html` file in your browser.

## How to Run

1. **Download or Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/grid-ball-game.git
   ```

2. **Open the Project**:
   Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. There is no need for a server, as the project is built using client-side HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

3. **Interact with the Game**:
   - **Speed Slider**: Use the speed slider to increase or decrease the game's frame rate.
   - **Resolution Slider**: Use the resolution slider to change the canvas size dynamically.

## Game Rules

- The game starts with two balls: one white and one black.
- The white ball moves in a random direction and colors the grid cells white as it moves.
- The black ball does the same but colors the cells black.
- The balls bounce off the canvas edges and also change direction when moving across grid cells.
- The goal is to see which ball colors more cells on the grid.

## Controls

- **Speed Slider**: Move the slider to the left to slow the game down, or to the right to speed it up.
- **Resolution Slider**: Move the slider to change the resolution (size) of the canvas. Increasing resolution enlarges the game area.

## Files

- `index.html` – Contains the HTML structure and sliders for game control.
- `style.css` – Styles for the game layout and sliders.
- `app.js` – Core JavaScript logic for the game, including ball movement, grid drawing, and collision detection.

## Requirements

No external libraries are needed for this project. It runs entirely in the browser using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Future Improvements

- Add more grid customization options such as color schemes.
- Include additional balls or obstacles for more complex interactions.
- Implement mobile touch controls for better gameplay on mobile devices.
